<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>The objective of this project was to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API working with a pre-trained sklearn model that predicts housing prices in Boston using certain parameters. It included setting up our virtual environment, installing dependencies and linting scripts.</p>

<p>Running docker scripts, making predictions, building images and pushing images to Docker Hub. Creating clusters and pods and also making predictions on kubernetes and then saving the output in a .txt file.</p>

<p>Finally, I created my CI pipeline using circleci.</p>
